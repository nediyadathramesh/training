SQL Joins with Examples
SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. There are several types of joins:

1. INNER JOIN
Returns only matching records from both tables.

Example:
Tables:
Employees

EmpID	Name	DeptID
1	John	101
2	Emma	102
3	Alex	103
Departments

DeptID	DeptName
101	HR
102	IT
104	Finance
Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Employees.EmpID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;
Output:

EmpID	Name	DeptName
1	John	HR
2	Emma	IT
2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.

Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Employees.EmpID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;
Output:

EmpID	Name	DeptName
1	John	HR
2	Emma	IT
3	Alex	NULL
3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.

Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Employees.EmpID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;
Output:

EmpID	Name	DeptName
1	John	HR
2	Emma	IT
NULL	NULL	Finance
4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for missing records.

Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Employees.EmpID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
FULL JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;
Output:

EmpID	Name	DeptName
1	John	HR
2	Emma	IT
3	Alex	NULL
NULL	NULL	Finance
5. CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (each row from the first table joins with all rows from the second table).

Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
CROSS JOIN Departments;
Output:

Name	DeptName
John	HR
John	IT
John	Finance
Emma	HR
Emma	IT
Emma	Finance
Alex	HR
Alex	IT
Alex	Finance
6. SELF JOIN
A table joins with itself.

Example: Finding employees with the same department.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT A.Name AS Employee1, B.Name AS Employee2, A.DeptID
FROM Employees A
JOIN Employees B ON A.DeptID = B.DeptID AND A.EmpID <> B.EmpID;
